# DND AI Art Bot
A Discord bot that is compatible with Stable Diffusion's Dreamstudio. 

Brought to you by [Haze: Saltborne](https://haze-saltborne.com), a group building immersive online roleplaying experiences. Join our [Discord](https://discord.com/invite/5c2XtWQSUm) to learn more! 

*Note there is nothing about this that limits the bot to D&D/fantasy art. Use it however you choose!*

## Setup
I'm hosting this bot on Railway. If you click the button to "Deploy on Railway" above, you'll just need two environmental variables:
* DISCORD_TOKEN to power your bot
* STABLE_DIFFUSION_TOKEN to connect to your Dreamstudio account

If you don't know where to find these values:

* Follow discord.py's [guide](https://discordpy.readthedocs.io/en/stable/discord.html) for creating a bot application. It's great--follow it step-by-step! It'll show you where to get the DISCORD_TOKEN
* You can find your Dreamstudio token by clicking into your membership settings over at Dreamstudio. Click on your profile's image -> Membership -> API Key.
